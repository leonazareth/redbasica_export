about=Professional-grade DXF export plugin for sewerage network designs in QGIS. This plugin revolutionizes sewerage network export by providing complete flexibility in layer selection and field mapping. Unlike traditional plugins that require hardcoded layer names ('PIPES', 'JUNCTIONS') and specific field structures, RedBasica Export allows users to select ANY layers from their QGIS project and map ANY field names to required sewerage network attributes.

    Key Features:
    • Universal Layer Support: Works with any layer names and structures
    • Intelligent Field Mapping: Auto-suggests mappings based on common patterns (QEsg, generic, multilingual)
    • Robust Data Conversion: Handles string numbers, NULL values, Portuguese decimals automatically
    • Professional DXF Output: Organized layers, blocks, arrows, labels, and 3D elevations
    • Self-Contained: Bundled ezdxf library - no external dependencies required
    • Multilingual Support: Portuguese and English interfaces with extensible translation system
    • QEsg Compatible: Maintains same high-quality output as original QEsg plugin
    • Comprehensive Validation: Real-time validation with detailed error reporting
    • Configuration Persistence: Remembers settings for quick repeated exports

    Perfect for engineers, designers, and CAD professionals working with diverse sewerage network data structures.
