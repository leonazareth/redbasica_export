# RedBasica Export - Flexible Sewerage DXF Export Plugin

Professional-grade DXF export plugin for sewerage network designs in QGIS with complete flexibility in layer selection and field mapping.

## üéØ Key Features

### Universal Compatibility
- Works with **ANY** layer names (not restricted to 'PIPES'/'JUNCTIONS')
- Supports **ANY** field naming conventions
- Compatible with existing QEsg projects and custom data structures

### Intelligent Field Mapping
- Auto-suggests field mappings based on common patterns
- Supports QEsg field names as suggestions (not requirements)
- Allows completely manual mapping when needed
- Handles multilingual field names (Portuguese, English, etc.)

### Robust Data Processing
- Converts string numbers ("1.05", "2,50") to proper numeric values
- Handles NULL/empty values gracefully with appropriate defaults
- Supports Portuguese decimal notation (comma to dot conversion)
- Automatic type conversion with fallback to safe defaults

### Professional DXF Output
- Organized layer structure compatible with AutoCAD
- 3D geometry support with elevation data
- Flow arrows and comprehensive labeling
- QEsg-compatible styling and blocks
- Extended entity data (XDATA) for software compatibility
