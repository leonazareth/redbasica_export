# AI Context and History

This project has been developed with the assistance of AI tools (Cursor, Kiro). 

## Historical Data
- **.cursor/**: Contains historical context, rules, and implementation notes from previous sessions. *Consult these files if you are unsure about past decisions.*
- **.kiro/**: Contains specifications and design documents. *Consult these for architectural alignment.*

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows
- **QGIS**: 3.x
- **Python**: Bundled with QGIS (usually 3.9+).
- **Dependencies**: Bundled in `addon/` directory. *Do not add `pip install` steps for end users.*

## Assistant Role
You are continuing the work of previous AI assistants. Respect the existing architecture (QEsg-based but flexible) and coding standards (PyQt5, ezdxf).
